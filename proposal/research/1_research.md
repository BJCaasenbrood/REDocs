**Co-Design: Morphology and Control:** 



Morphology, in the context of biology, is defined as the study of the form, structure, and material composition of organisms and their constituent parts, with emphasis on how these attributes determine function and facilitate environmental adaptation. This discipline investigates the relationship between anatomical features — such as shape, size, and material organization — and their functional and adaptive significance in evolutionary and ecological contexts. An excellent example of applied morphology in engineering is found in "\textit{soft robotics}". Soft robots, a modern subdomain of robotics, leverages on compliant materials to enhance adaptability and dexterity. The importance of morphology in facilitating control has been widely recognized within its research community, where designs are often inspired by biological systems that simplify controller design.

However, in the broader field of engineering, the deliberate integration of morphology into controller design processes remains rare, despite its critical role in the development of high-precision mechanical systems that should be driven by the increasing demand of the semiconductor industry. From a mechatronic perspective, the morphology of a mechanical system—encompassing its geometric configuration of degree of freedom, mass distribution, stiffness, and damping properties and thus constitutes the fundamental aspects of its dynamic behavior. These morphological parameters govern the system’s response to internal and external inputs and directly influence control design. Thus, while the terminology may differ, the underlying principle persists: \textbf{structure dictates function}, whether in the study of natural organism, soft robotics, or high precision systems. 

Co-design represents a recent paradigm shift in system engineering framework, emphasizing the simultaneous optimization of a mechanical system’s morphology and its associated control to maximize performance. Unlike traditional design approaches—which often treat mechanical design and control as sequential, independent processes—c
