**Abstract:** *Computional design*, also referred to as *co-design*, is recently emerging, transformative approach optimizing structure and governing control law. Traditionally, the design philosophy in mechatronic systems has been predominantly driven by user requirements, with structural design and control treated as sequential and largely independent processes. In this paradigm, the mechanical design is established first (often without the consideration control's impact on dynamics) and control strategies are subsequently implemented to ensure robust system operation.
Co-design, on the other hand, enables the simultaneous refinement of both the physical architecture and the control algorithms, thereby enhancing system performance and robust environment adaptability. By leveraging dynamic (topology) optimization, the proposed framework seeks to address the limitations of conventional design methodologies, particularly in the context of high-precision applications where the interplay between structure and control are of paramount importance. The anticipated outcomes include improved motion accuracy, vibration mitigation, and adaptive responses to varying operational conditions, ultimately advancing the capabilities of next-generation mechatronic systems.

Such application has focused on static or passively moving components, often limited to rigid materials and simple contact scenarios. However, the increasing demand for advanced mechatronic devices — such as precision wafer stages, compliant docking mechanisms, and integrated actuator structures—demands the design of systems capable of complex, dynamic motion and interaction. Designing such systems presents significant challenges, particularly when accounting for large deformations, intricate contact behaviors, and the interplay between structure and active control.

The optimal configuration of a mechatronic system is inherently linked to its operational dynamics, necessitating a co-design methodology that simultaneously considers both morphology and control. To address these challenges, the research proposal will explore dynamic topology optimization framework tailored for high-precision mechatronic systems. This approach extends conventional density-based optimization by incorporating temporal evolution, enabling the concurrent optimization of structural layout and actuation strategies for specific dynamic tasks. By employing multi-indexed density variables across the spatiotemporal domain, our method efficiently captures material distribution, actuator placement, and time-dependent control inputs. Gradient-based optimization techniques, combined with advanced simulation methods such as the material point method and automatic differentiation, facilitate robust forward and backward analysis of system behavior. -->
